    """\033: This is the escape character, which signals that a control sequence is about to follow.

[1;32;40m: This is the sequence that defines the text formatting and color:

1: This makes the text bold.
32: This sets the text color to green.
40: This sets the background color to black.
m : sequence terminator

So, when you use \033[1;32;40m, you're telling the terminal to print the following text in bold green with a black background.

To reset the formatting back to normal, we use the reset code \033[0m, which is included at the end of the string (\033[0m) in the code"""
