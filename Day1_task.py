# This program demonstrates two ways of printing the steps for making bread.
# It first prints each step individually, then combines them into one single print statement.

# Step 1: Using multiple print statements to output each step

print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.")
print("2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
print("3. Add 3g of Salt.")
print("4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
print("5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")

# Step 2: Using a single print statement to combine all the steps
# Below we combine the steps into one print statement using newline characters "\n".

print("\n--- Using a single print statement ---\n")
print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.\n"
      "2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.\n"
      "3. Add 3g of Salt.\n"
      "4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.\n"
      "5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")

"""
The code above has two sections:

1. First, we print each instruction individually using separate print statements.
2. Then, we use a single print statement to combine all the steps together, using '\n' to break lines.

The multi-line comment (triple quotes) explains the structure of the program and the logic behind each step.
